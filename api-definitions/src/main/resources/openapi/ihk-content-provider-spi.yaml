        Generate one or more one-time passwords for accessing a specific graduation
        A one-time password (otp) can be used to access a graduation content or to perform actions related to it.
        Each OTP is associated with a specific content and subject (user).
        The content is identified by a content_id and normally is unique for each graduation and profession.
